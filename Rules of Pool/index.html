            <p id="text">The object of pool is to pot all of your 
                designated balls (either stripes or solids) and then pot the 
                8 ball, thus winning the game. As pool matches often consist of 
                several games in a ‘best out of’ format, players attempt to 
                win as many games as needed to win the match. 
                Players must use their skills in both attack and safety play, 
                as well as tactical nous to help them win the match.</p>

        <div id="objective" class="center">
            <h3 id = "subheading">Players and Equipment</h3>
            <p>To play pool, the following pieces of equipment are required:</p>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li><b>Table</b> - The table used in pool is approximately 9 feet by
                     4.5 feet although games can often be played on differing sized tables.
                </li>
                <li><b>Balls</b> - 16 balls in total, comprising a white cue ball, 
                    seven striped balls, seven solid balls, and one black ball (8 ball)
                </li>
                <li><b>Cues</b> - Players have a cue each which can be made from 
                    wood, carbon fibre, or fibreglass and this is used for striking the cue ball.
                </li>
                <li><b>Chalk</b> - To ensure they have more control over their 
                    shots, each player tends to chalk the end of their cue to 
                    ensure there is good contact between the cue and the ball.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="scoring" class="center">
            <h3 id = "subheading">Scoring</h3>
            <p>There is no score as such in pool with both players simply 
                attempting to pot all of their designated object balls and then 
                potting the 8 ball into the pocket that they have chosen. 
                However, pool matches are often played over a number of games, 
                so for example, in a best of nine frame match, the first player 
                to reach five frames would be declared the winner.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="scoring" class="center">
            <h3 id = "winning">Winning the Game</h3>
            <p>8 Ball pool is won when one of the following occurs:</p>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>A player pots all of their designated balls and then legally 
                    pockets the 8 ball into their nominated pocket. 
                </li>
                <li>The opposing player illegally pots the 8 ball before 
                    clearing their own set of balls.
                </li>
                <li>The 8 ball is knocked of the table by the opposition.
                </li>

            </ul>
